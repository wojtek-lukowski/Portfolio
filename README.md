### Software Engineer with a UX Design Background

I am a DÃ¼sseldorf based <strong>Software Engineer</strong> with a UX Design background.

I find pleasure in a constant debugging and I am always looking forward to a new error message as a progress indicator. I work with HTML | CSS/SCSS | JavaScript | Node | Express | React | React Native | Angular | MongoDB and many more.

This portfolio is fully has been built and styled with vanilla/custom HTML, CSS and some JavaScript (the only exception is the jQuery hamburger menu) and features my Wed Development and UX Design projects.
