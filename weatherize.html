      <p>
        Weatherize is a responsive web weather app for water sports enthusiasts, designed by me as a sole UX/UI Designer during the UX Design course by CareerFoundry.
        Tools: pen & paper, Adobe Creative Suite (XD, Photoshop, Illustrator), Google Forms, Optimal Sort, Usability Hub.
        Timeline: 4 months (September-December 2020).
        While designing the app, I applied the principles of the User Centred Design Process.
        My objective was to design an app that would be simple, easy and give users a fast access to the weather data they want to see. I also wanted it to be different that most of the existing weather apps in terms of its "look & feel".

          The initial stage of the design process. Its objective is to understand users and their problems, competitors and the market environment. Consists of a competitive analysis and user research.

            <p>
              The first step was to take a look at two water sports specialised weather services: Surfline and WindyApp. This only showed that, although the weather data is very comprehensive, it is presented in a rather complex, unclear and
              difficult to
              understand way. Moreover, the "look & feel" and the way the data is displayed is very similar in most of the weather apps (not only the ones I have taken a closer look at).

          <h3>The User Research Plot</h3>
          <p>
            I started the process of understanding my target group with conducting an on-line survey to gather some initial information about the users, their needs and behaviours regarding both - the water sports and the weather apps.
            My intention was to use the learnings from the survey to polish the user interview questionnaire, for the interviews which I was planning to run afterwards.

        <div class="container">
          <h4>User Interviews</h4>
          <p>
            I run three on-line interviews with the following objectives (the full interview questionnaire):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>identify water sports enthusiasts’ general attitude towards weather and (water sports) weather apps and their general usage patterns & habits;</li>
            <li>check some design directions related to features (social media) and design;</li>
            <li>explore the specific insights/findings from the survey and generate new insights to be used during the next stages of the design process.</li>

            <h4>Research Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              I performed the analysis of the interviews using the affinity mapping technique and came up with the insights allowing me to take actionable steps and create the solutions fulfilling users’ needs.
              The research showed that all that the users want and need is a simple and not overcomplicated app with a fast access to the most important data, which will be presented in a clear and easy to understand way, so that they will be able to
              use it "with one finger" even in unfavourable conditions (e.g. on a rocking boat during a heavy rain).
              The users also confirmed that most of the apps are looking the same and complicated way, therefore it would be nice to have an app which is different that the others and presents the data in a more user-friendly way.
              Further, the research confirmed that my potentia users are a group of very active people, who love to practice their water sports and cannot wait the moment they are out there on the water again, very often regardless of the weather
              conditions. Additionally, I have also identified some features that could be considered on the later stages, after the MVP is completed. These could potentially be: live web cams for the locations, possibility of taking a picture with
              the current weather data and the location displayed or some social features (e.g. chat).

        <h2>Concepting</h2>
        <p>
          The objective of this stage is to look at the future product with the eyes of its future users and anticipating how they are going to use it, creating user personas, user journeys, user flows and the information architecture.

        <h3>User Personas</h3>
        <p>
          Based on the learnings and insights from the research, I have created my user personas, reflecting potential users with different needs and different usage patterns.

        <h3>User Journeys</h3>
        <p>
          Once the user personas have been brought to life, I identified the specific tasks and actions that they would be willing to complete while using the app. I used the learnings and insights from the research to support this process.

        <p>
          The next step were detailed user flows allowing to establish and define each step of the users navigating through the app in order to fulfil their goals (including potential mistakes/errors they could make on their way). I identified the
          following three main user tasks and focused the design process around them:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>sign up (create account),</li>
          <li>searching for a location and adding it to favourites,</li>

          I repared an initial sitemap based on my personas and their potential flows, as well as my vision for the app. This has been followed by the card sorting to verify my assumptions, and I was happy the confirm that the initial sitemap was
          correct and it did not require any revisions.

          This is the stage of the process, when the initial ideas are transformed into the physical format so that they can be experienced and interacted with by others. These interactions result in feedback that is used to improve the product. It
          consists of wireframes, prototypes and different kinds of testing.

        <h3>Wireframes & Prototypes</h3>
        <p>
          Keeping in mind the simplicity and the fast access to the weather data, I began sketching the pen & paper low fidelity mobile and desktop wireframes for the three main features of the app (sign up, searching for a location and adding it to
          favourites and checking the weather for an upcoming weekend for a location from the favourites).
          Once I was happy with the flow and navigation on the lo-fi level, I have taken the wireframes to the mid and high-fidelity levels using Adobe XD.

          <p>
            I performed a range of activities in order to get the feedback on my work and be able to remove potential problems and friction points as well as learn about any possible improvements. The most important were the Usability Test in order
            to check whether the users are able to perform the three main tasks on the hi-fidelity prototype. On top of that, I have also run three rounds of the Preference Test to check users' preference to particular elements of the design. Later
            on, I have shared my work (on the mock-up stage) with my three fellow students (Peer Review), so that they could also give their feedback to my design.

          <p>
            I run six remote tests (using Skype). I was happy to find out that all the participants completed all the tasks with no major frictions and the prototype has been evaluated as very intuitional, clear & simple and "straight to the point".
            Only some minor areas for improvement have been identified:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>a bit misleading additional option to search the locations on the dashboard,</li>
            <li>lacking social log-in option,</li>
            <li>confusing warning sign by the error message when creating an account,</li>
            <li>adding to favs confirmation has been displayed for a too short time,</li>
            <li>the way the password requirements displayed not clear enough).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I have used the affinity mapping and the rainbow spreadsheet to analyse the material, identify the learnings and formulate the recommended revisions to the prototype.
