      <p>
        Weatherize is a responsive web weather app for water sports enthusiasts, designed by me as a sole UX/UI Designer during the UX Design course by CareerFoundry.
        Tools: pen & paper, Adobe Creative Suite (XD, Photoshop, Illustrator), Google Forms, Optimal Sort, Usability Hub.
        Timeline: 4 months (September-December 2020).
        While designing the app, I applied the principles of the User Centred Design Process.
        My objective was to design an app that would be simple, easy and give users a fast access to the weather data they want to see. I also wanted it to be different that most of the existing weather apps in terms of its "look & feel".

        <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          The first step was to take a look at two water sports specialised weather services: Surfline and WindyApp. This only showed that, although the weather data is very comprehensive, it is presented in a rather complex, unclear and difficult to
          understand way. Moreover, the "look & feel" and the way the data is displayed is very similar in most of the weather apps (not only the ones I have taken a closer look at).

          <h3>The User Research Plot</h3>
          <p>
            I started the process of understanding my target group with conducting an on-line survey to gather some initial information about the users, their needs and behaviours regarding both - the water sports and the weather apps.
            My intention was to use the learnings from the survey to polish the user interview questionnaire, for the interviews which I was planning to run afterwards.

            to
            understand way. Moreover, the "look & feel" and the way the data is displayed is very similar in most of the weather apps (not only the ones I have taken a closer look at).

          <h4>Research Analysis</h4>
          <p>
            I performed the analysis of the interviews using the affinity mapping technique and came up with the insights allowing me to take actionable steps and create the solutions fulfilling users’ needs.
            The research showed that all that the users want and need is a simple and not overcomplicated app with a fast access to the most important data, which will be presented in a clear and easy to understand way, so that they will be able to
            use it "with one finger" even in unfavourable conditions (e.g. on a rocking boat during a heavy rain).
            The users also confirmed that most of the apps are looking the same and complicated way, therefore it would be nice to have an app which is different that the others and presents the data in a more user-friendly way.
            Further, the research confirmed that my potentia users are a group of very active people, who love to practice their water sports and cannot wait the moment they are out there on the water again, very often regardless of the weather
            conditions.
            Additionally, I have also identified some features that could be considered on the later stages, after the MVP is completed. These could potentially be: live web cams for the locations, possibility of taking a picture with the current
            weather data and the location displayed or some social features (e.g. chat).
