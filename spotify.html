              example for the "Release Radar" playlist, which is a Spotify generated playlist with new releases
              customized especially for the user, based on the music and artists he listens to. I run the playlist and
              then scan the list of tracks.
              Whenever I find a track from the artist I am interested in, I immediately want to see whether it is just a
              signle new track or a complete new album.

          <p>I like the idea of "This is (artist)" playlist. However, very often browsing this kind of list, I want to
            <b>directly switch to the particular artists' page</b>.
          </p>
          <p>While on desktop the artist's page can be accessed directly (by clicking the artist name on one of the
            tracks), on mobile this possibility is missing and the task can be completed either by using the playback
            panel/screen (option
            availabvle only when the playlist is currentle playing) or by using the three dots menu of one of the tracks
            and scrolling for the “View artist(s)” option. Both of them are not direct and thus far from perfect.
          </p>
          <p><b>Existing option 1:</b> using the playback panel/screen (available only when the playlist playing).

          <p><b>Suggested solution:</b> implementing the artist's icon to the playlist screen (analogically to the way
            it is implemented on album screens), which directly links to the artist's page.

          </picture>
          <p>The alternative solution would be to link the big, playlist icon to the artist's page. The advantage ot
            this option would be the fact that the playlist icon is bigger, thus easier to tap. The disadvantage - that
            this solution has not yet
            been used by the service, so the users are not used to it.

        <div class="container bottomborder" id="fix3">
          <h3 class="paddingtop">Alarm clock</h3>
          <p>While I already enjoy the "Sleep timer" feature, that allows me to fall asleep listening to my favorite
            calming down music, <b>I am still missing waking up to the music</b>. I do not understand why Spotify does
            not offer such a basic and
            comforting function. There may be some reasons behind that that I do not know, therefore, <b>I have designed
              a Spotify alarm clock</b>. Actually, two versions of it.
          <p>One very important assumption is that the music which is supposed to be set as a wake up music must be
            downloaded to the device. This is for the technical reasons - e.g. when the users set an alarm with
            non-downloaded music, but their
            mobile data usage is disabled
            and there is no wifi - then the alarm music could not be played off-line. For this reason, when the users
            sets up non-downloaded music, Spotify will ask for the permission to download it.
          </p>
          <p>The first option is very simple. With a one-off alarm that needs to be activated every time you want your
            music to wake you up.
          </p>

            <img src="img/spotify/fix3-1@2.png" alt="weatherize">
          </picture>
          <p>The second option is more complex, as it allows to set up multiple alarms with various albums and playlists
            and various activation schemes.

          <h3 class="paddingtop">Removing albums from the Album Library</h3>
          <p>As I keep adding albums to my Album Library, it gradually becomes a mess and I need a "clean up session"
            from time to time. The current way to remove an album from the "Albums" sections looks like this:
          </p>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/spotify/fix5-1@1.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
            <img src="img/spotify/fix5-1@2.png" alt="weatherize">
          </picture>
          <p>While it is not really complicated, removing a number of albums one after another becomes irritating, as I
            constantly need to switch between the "Albums" and the particular album screens, unclikcking the heart for
            each album.
          </p>
          <p>I believe that it could be done faster, smoother and thus more efficient. The most intuitional way would be
            to "swipe left and delete", but the swipe gesture on this screen is already reserved for switching from
            Music to Podcasts(and
            swipe right from "Albums" to "Artists"). Therefore I have designed two alternative options.
          </p>
          <p>Option 1 - deleting individual albums</p>

          <p>I have a problem with the <b>chaos rising in my Albums Library</b> as I keep adding there new albums (which
            I want to remember for any reason) and therefore, I <b>miss some system to manage and catalogue these albums
              (</b><a href="#folders">click here to skip further explanations and go directly to the design</a>).

            <div class="column col-md-6 col-lg-8 text">
              <p><b>They are all there altogether</b>, side-by-side, classical music with hip-hop and heavy metal with
                new age, albums for sport, dining and sleeping, albums that I always come back to with albums that I
                listen now, but I know that I
                will forget
                them in couple of days and on top, albums of the artists I have never heard about before, but I just
                want to check them out at some point. All perfectly mixed up in a sequence in which they have been added
                (ok, I can change the
                sorting to
                “Titles” or “Artists”, but that does not really help much, as Chopin will be next to The Cure,
                Rachmaninoff next to Rammstein and Metallica next to Mozart… not the type of sorting I have in mind).
                So, every time I want to find an
                album
                from my Library, I need to browse through the mess. No, it’s not about simply typing the title in the
                finder either – sometimes I want to see all of my e.g. “sport” albums and then decide which one I am
                going to be listening, but I
                need
                to see them all first. Or, for the artists that are added “for later” I very often do not remember
                either the name of the artist or the title of the album – I just need to see the cover, as that is all I
                can recall.

          <p>Theoretically that could easily be solved if, instead of saving my albums in Albums, I would create
            separate dedicated playlists and simply save the albums there. Then I would have for example “Sport”,
            “Sleep”, “Listen later”,
            “Classical”, "Good Mood", "Bad Mood" or “My treasures” playlists. Sounds perfect, but…
          </p>
          <p>…the playlists are created with combining rather individual tracks than (more or less) complete albums in

              a list tracks with either an album icon assigned to each track (mobile) or album title listed (desktop).
              If one of the albums
              happens to be for example a 200 tracks long “Chopin: Classical Music for Reading” then that is a quite a
              bit of scrolling.
