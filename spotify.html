              <h2>Background</h2>
              <p>I am a heavy Spotify user. I usually listen to the music, using the app all day long, from early morning into late night. Spotify allows me to come back to the tunes I love, but also experiment and discover new sounds. Therefore, I am quite well acquainted with Spotify’s user interface. While, overall, I appreciate it, I have some ideas how I personally would make it even better. Below, you will find these ideas explained. Please remember that these improvements are designed from my personal perspective and I have not consulted them with other users nor conducted any tests or research. I also have no knowledge whether Spotify team have looked at similar issues and whether potentially they decided not to follow up on them.
              </p>
              <p>These are the ideas:</p>

                  <li><a href="#fix2">Direct access from the playlist to the album page of a track from this playlist (mobile);</a></li>

        <h3>Accessing the artist's page from the "This is (artist)" playlist</h3>
        <p>I like the idea of "This is (artist)" playlist. However, very often browsing this kind of list, I want to <b>directly switch to the particualr artists' page</b>.
        </p>
        <p>While on desktop the artist's page can be accessed directly (by clicking the artist name on one of the tracks), on mobile this possibility is missing and the task can be completed either by using the playback panel/screen (option
          availabvle only when the playlist is currentle playing) or by using the three dots menu of one of the tracks and scrolling for the “View artist(s)” option. Both of them are not direct and thus far from perfect.
        </p>
        <p><b>Existing option 1:</b> using the playback panel/screen (available only when the playlist playing).

          <img src="img/spotify/fix1-2@2.png" alt="weatherize">
        </picture>
        <p><b>Suggested solution:</b> implementing the artist's icon to the playlist screen (analogically to the way it is implemented on album screens), which directly links to the artist's page.
        </p>

          <img src="img/spotify/fix1-3@2.png" alt="weatherize">
        </picture>
        <p>The alternative solution would be to link the big, playlist icon to the artist's page. The advantage ot this option would be the fact that the playlist icon is bigger, thus easier to tap. The disadvantage - that this solution has not yet
          been used by the service, so the users are not used to it.

        <h3>Direct access from the playlist to the album page of a track from this playlist (mobile)</h3>
        <p>When I listen to different playlists, it happens to me relatively often that <b>I want to see the album pages of some tracks from the playlist</b> (not necessary the tracks which is playing at the very moment). This is very true for
          example for the "Release Radar" playlist, which is a Spotify generated playlist with new releases customized especially for the user, based on the music and artists he listens to. I run the playlist and then scan the list of tracks.
          Whenever I find a track from the artist I am interested in, I immediately want to see whether it is just a signle new track or a complete new album.
        </p>
        <p>While on desktop, it can be done by clicking the album title in the playlist's list of tracks, on mobile it requires more actions.

        <h3>Alarm clock</h3>
        <p>While I already enjoy the "Sleep timer" feature, that allows me to fall asleep listening to my favorite calming down music, <b>I am still missing waking up to the music</b>. I do not understand why Spotify does not offer such a basic and
          comforting function. There may be some reasons behind that that I do not know, therefore, <b>I have designed a Spotify alarm clock</b>. Actually, two versions of it.
        <p>One very important assumption is that the music which is supposed to be set as a wake up music must be downloaded to the device. This is for the technical reasons - e.g. when the users set an alarm with non-downloaded music, but their
          mobile data usage is disabled
          and there is no wifi - then the alarm music could not be played off-line. For this reason, when the users sets up non-downloaded music, Spotify will ask for the permission to download it.
        </p>
        <p>The first option is very simple. With a one-off alarm that needs to be activated every time you want your music to wake you up.

          <img src="img/spotify/fix3-1@2.png" alt="weatherize">
        </picture>
        <p>The second option is more complex, as it allows to set up multiple alarms with various albums and playlists and various activation schemes.

        <h3>Album View Mode for Playlist</h3>
        <p>This problem is a bit more complicated, as it spans across more than one feature, so it requires more explanations.
        </p>
        <p>What I miss in general is some kind of a <b>more developed system to manage, catalogue and store albums</b>. My “Albums” section is a one big mess, as I throw there all albums that I want to remember, regardless what the reason for that is. So, I
          have it altogether, side-by-side, classical music with hip-hop and heavy metal with new age, albums for sport, dining and sleeping, albums that I always come back to with albums that I listen now, but I know that I will forget them in
          couple of days and on top, albums of the artists I have never heard about before, but I just want to check them out at some point. All perfectly mixed up in a sequence in which they have been added (ok, I can change the sorting to “Titles”
          or “Artists”, but that does not really help much, as Chopin will be next to The Cure, Mozart next to Metallica and Rachmaninoff next to Rammstein… not the type of sorting I have in mind). So, every time I want to find an album from my collection, I <b>need to browse
          through the chaos of albums</b> (no, it’s not about simply typing the title in the finder – sometimes I want to see all of my e.g. “sport” albums and then decide which one I am going to be listening, but I need to see them all first. Or, for
          the artists that are added “for later” I very often do not remember neither the name of the artist or the title of the album – I just need to see the cover, as that is all I remember).
        </p>
        <p>Now, that could easily be solved if, instead of saving my albums in Albums, I would create separate dedicated playlists and save the albums there, in the respective playlists. So, I would have for example a playlist for “Sport”, “Sleep”,
          “Listen later”, “Classical” or “My treasure”. Theoretically perfect, but there is one problem…
        </p>
        <p>..there is <b>no way to clearly see what albums are on the particular playlist</b> and there is no efficient way to manage them. Try to perform the following tasks:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Quick overview of the albums included in the playlist.</b> No, you can’t see the album covers displayed next to each other. Instead, you have a list of the tracks with either an album icon assigned to each track (mobile) or album title listed
            (desktop). Now, try to scroll for example thorough all the 200 tracks of the “Chopin: Classical Music for Reading” to see what is the next album on the playlist.
          </li>
          <li><b>Removing a complete album (or all the tracks from one album that are on the particular playlist)</b>, especially while using a smartphone. While by using the "Find in Playlist" search, I can actually find all the tracks belonging to one album, but I still need to select them all and delete (desktop) or delete one-by (either by ”edit playlist” reached by the playlist three dots menu or by opening the individual three dots menus of the particular tracks for the mobile version). Good luck, especially, if you now decide to remove all the 200 tracks of the "Chopin: Classical Music for Reading" from your playlist.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The example playlist below has only four albums, but image that there are fifty or even more of them on the playlist...
        </p>

        </picture>
        <p class="description">The playlists consisting of only four albums spans for ten screens and there is no possibility to see just the four album covers next to each other.
        </p>
        <p>Therefore, I have designed a way to <b>implement the “album cover view”</b> (which already exists at Spotify – in the Albums section) <b>to the playlists</b>. I know that it can be controversial, as lot of playlists consist of single or some selected
          tracks rather than complete albums, so this listing would show “incomplete” albums (and in extreme cases there would be exactly as many albums as tracks in a playlist if each track comes from a different album). Nevertheless, I believe that
          there are people who still listen to albums and not only to single tracks, so the options to just see the playlist's albums would be helpful for them (well, it would be definitely helpful for me).

        <p class="description">The Album View Mode for Playlist for the desktop version.</p>
        <p>As this solution is quite complex it would require extensive testing, especially regarding the "alternative" album page to check whether it is not confusing and miselading for the users.
